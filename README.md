# Rain over Africa

This README is to be completed, it contains minimal information.

The code for running retrievals is likely final, pending the RoA paper review. We donâ€™t plan to make backwards-incompatible updates, but additional code for analyses can be updated or added.

Requirements:
- Linux
- Python 3.10

Installation of RoA:
```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/SEE-GEO/roa
```

You can also clone the repository and install locally. In any case, you need the file [`data/network_CPU.pt`](data/network_CPU.pt) from this repository.

Note that many unused dependencies are installed as they are required by other dependencies.

For an illustrative example of complete retrievals, check [`docs/example.ipynb`](docs/example.ipynb).
